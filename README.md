How to Implement a "Raise Your Hand" Feature Using the Daily.co API.

## Introduction
When people gather in real life, there are many situations where it makes sense to raise our hands:
 - In a classroom, you might raise your hand to answer a teacher's question.
 - You may raise your hand to volunteer for an improv comedy routine.
 - Members of political bodies may raise their hands to indicate a "yea" or "nay" vote.

 What about when we gather online? It turns out that hand-raising is just as popular and necessary 
 in digital spaces as it is in physical ones.

 In this tutorial, we will walk through implementing hand-raising functionality using the Daily.co API,
 which makes it easy peasy to add video chat to any web or mobile app. I'll be setting up a live site 
 using Firebase and vanilla web technologies, but you can use any web host or framework you'd like.

## Setup
